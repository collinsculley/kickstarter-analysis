#### Conclusion and Recommendation
After analyzing the relevant data provided, my conclusion and recommendations for your campaign are:
* There was inconclusive analysis surrounding the specific theater/play funding objectives.  A deeper look into the purpose of each campaign, and their relation to funding goals, might provide further insight.  Categorizing specific theater or play campaign objectives that match your goals would be beneficial.
* Launch US campaign in May, June, or July.  Avoid early and late months of the year.
* Set campaign goal to $5,000 or less (USD).  Having lofty goals higher than this amount largely failed to meet their goals.
* See your campaign through to the end.  Historically there have been no canceled play campaigns so it would be beneficial to capture as much funding as possible, despite not necessarily trending to meet your goal.
